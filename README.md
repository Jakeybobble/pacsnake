# Pac-snake
A rust/bevy remake of [Pac-Snake-Like](https://jakeybobble.itch.io/pacsnakelike), a game I made in GameMaker in 100 minutes for the [10² Jam](https://itch.io/jam/10-squared-jam) back in 2020.  

# Goals
- Make it work well on web.
- Mouse, keyboard and mobile control scheme.
- Sound effects!
- Local leaderboard?
